IRC Parsing Engine Class
©2007 - Jason James Newland

Purpose:
       The purpose of this class is to parse the individual
       events coming from an IRC session and splitting them
       up so it just raises the relevant events.
       Saves large parsing subs, especially when it comes to
       PRIVMSG, as you have to parse private/channel action/text,
       CTCP's and DCC's.

Usage: (Declarations)
       Private WithEvents cParser As cIRCParser
Form/Class load:
       Set cParser = New cIRCParser
For/Class unload:
       Set cParser = Nothing

Method:
       To parse socket data, get the data into a string, pass that
       directly to ParseRAWSocketData sVariableName.
       When parsed, it will raise SocketDataOutput sFirst, sSecond, sThird, sFourth.
       The reason for this is so an IRC client can override any
       further parsing for various reasons.

       Just simply pass the output of this event back to the Parse
       routine of this class.

NOTE:
       strMe is a string that is set to your current IRC
       nick name.
